Takes a set of 9 letters and returns the longest words in which all the letters of the word are in the provided set.
Letters are only counted once in the set (so 'a','b' does not match the word "baa").
Like that what they do on a long running TV series in which one can win a teapot.

Words are looked for in a word list file where each word is on a separate line. This file needs to be provided by the user.

* Running
/N.B. I've only tested this with SBCL on Linux though it should work with other Lisp implementations/

1. Change into the project directory
2. Start the REPL
3. Load the solver.lisp file (=(load "solver.lisp")=)
4. =(wordsearcher:start)=

* Building a standalone binary

1. Either place the project or a symlink to the project in ASDF's central registry (if you've installed Quicklisp placing it in =~/quicklisp/local-projects/= works).
2. =cd wordsearch-cl=
3. Run =sbcl --eval "(asdf:operate :build-op :wordsearcher)"=. The binary should be built in the build folder.
